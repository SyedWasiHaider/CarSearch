# CarSearch
Using Xamarin Forms to create an awesome car search app. UX/UI choices are mostly for fun.

###Usage

* Open up the .sln file in Xamarin Studio or Visual Studio
* Set startup project to iOS (since that's the only platform I've actually tested)
* Build and Run

###Some cool libraries I'm using:

* Realm
* Xamarin.Forms.CarouselView
* ffimageloading
* modernhttpclient
